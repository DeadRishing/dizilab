1
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,380
Not content with an atlas of Patagonia,

2
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,800
he then proceeded to devour a first edition Gatsby.

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,170
You want him to stop eating your books,

4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,290
stop buying 'em leather-bound.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,040
I'll buy you a new one.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,000
I don't believe I pay you enough

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,990
to replace it, Mr. Reese, and you're missing the point.

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,400
Some things simply cannot be replaced.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,170
Coffee.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,180
Finch, they didn't have your Sencha thing,

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,670
so I got you Mint Medley.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,630
Oh, I'll go without then, thank you.

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,750
Hydrating on a stakeout is a double-edged sword anyway.

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,030
You forget your water bottle, Finch?

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,020
Okay, here he is.

16
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,410
Evening, Benny.

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,760
Why are we watching him again?

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,110
We have credible information that Mr. Belasco

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,320
has run afoul of HR.

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,800
A member of that organization may try to kill him,

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,340
or he may try to kill one of them, I suppose,

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,900
but it seems unlikely.

23
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,760
Credible information, huh?

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,090
I trust that the two of you have this covered.

25
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,330
Yeah, we just got to wait here

26
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,070
to see which dirty cop shows up to kill Benny.

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,670
Then we'll save his life.

28
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,650
You make our work sound so simple.

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,850
It must be. You're leaving us.

30
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,030
You brought home a beast.

31
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,170
I have to walk it and water it

32
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,680
and feed it, lest it consume any more of my books.

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,100
Mr. Reese. Detective.

34
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,610
Uh-uh, no.

35
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,710
Come on, this is a classic.

36
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,410
Classic rock puts me to sleep.

37
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,470
Still trying to get used to this.

38
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,210
- Being early. - Early?

39
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,250
I'm homicide, John.

40
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,860
Usually if you're spending time with me,

41
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,840
it's because you're already dead.

42
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,980
Just look at him,

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,910
just walking around.

44
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,160
Don't even know what's coming for him.

45
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,470
He ought to,

46
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,060
stealing from a bunch of corrupt cops.

47
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,080
Nah, I've seen a lot of dead bodies.

48
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,620
You know what they all had in common?

49
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,000
Not one of them looked like they saw it coming.

50
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,920
Hey, Wonder Boy.

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,710
Time to pretend to be a detective again.

52
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,190
Two Brotherhood guys shot dead.

53
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,860
I'm not answering any questions.

54
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,730
Elias's guy-- sole survivor.

55
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,990
His name's Carlo.

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,810
See what I can find out.

57
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,380
Finch, I got two dead Brotherhood guys

58
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,970
whose numbers never came up.

59
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,440
This some kind of glitch in the Machine?

60
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,620
I certainly hope not.

61
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,470
Perhaps this is a crime of opportunity.

62
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,490
The Machine only sees premeditation.

63
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,890
Could be Elias ordered the shooting

64
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,660
in retaliation against Dominic

65
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,330
for disappearing three of his men.

66
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,440
And we've just received a new number

67
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,050
unrelated to Dominic or Elias.

68
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,440
Chase Patterson, 25,

69
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,220
his family slain in 2008.

70
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,250
Chase was a prime suspect at the time.

71
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,440
Was he ever convicted?

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,790
No, before he could be charged or arrested,

73
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,200
Mr. Patterson fled the country.

74
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,030
He's just returned to New York City

75
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,030
after seven years in Paris.

76
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,840
You and Fusco stay on Dominic and Elias.

77
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,170
I can handle one murderer on my own.

78
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,570
Alleged murderer.

79
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,230
Maybe Chase's case file can help clear that up.

80
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,440
I'll go down to evidence and take a look.

81
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,030
Congratulations?

82
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,580
Don't go buying me that blender just yet, Harry.

83
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,900
With Samaritan hunting down the Machine,

84
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,890
I figured we should start our own search for her.

85
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,340
I tried to get close to someone

86
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,960
I thought had inside information.

87
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,390
It ended badly.

88
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,200
Not only am I still on the market,

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,240
but we have no leads to help us find her.

90
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,590
Ms. Groves, how would you like to try your hand

91
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,790
at stopping a gang war?

92
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,790
It would involve determining

93
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,370
whether the Machine is functioning properly.

94
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,640
When do we start?

95
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,160
Must be some kind of mistake.

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,830
I just wanted the Patterson case file.

97
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,470
Wasn't in its proper place.

98
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,900
Found it in the primary detective's effects.

99
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,800
Effects?

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,650
Detective's things are evidence now.

101
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,350
Evidence? Why?

102
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,850
She was murdered.

103
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,220
You're cold?

104
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,010
Oh, no, I'm good.

105
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,430
You know what's worse than a stakeout?

106
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,910
Going back to the precinct at 5:00 AM

107
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,970
doing three hours of paperwork about a stakeout.

108
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,610
There's no paperwork when you're working

109
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,380
with me and Finch.

110
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,880
Good thing. The stunts you pull...

111
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,400
Military wasn't much better.

112
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,980
Lots of red tape to go around there too.

113
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,300
Never cared much for red tape.

114
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,510
My time wasn't like yours, though.

115
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,660
You were an officer. I was a grunt.

116
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,810
Wasn't really good at anything,

117
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,110
not at first.

118
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,200
But later, what were you good at then?

119
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,910
Taking orders.

120
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,310
Got a little too good at that.

121
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,980
You ever think about the future,

122
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,240
doing something else?

123
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,710
Sure.

124
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,150
Some days, I see so much death,

125
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,900
I just think about putting in my 20

126
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,430
and getting out.

127
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,650
Where would you go?

128
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,240
A beach.

129
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,270
Yeah, somewhere where there's no blood.

130
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,230
No showing up on somebody's doorstep

131
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,830
with news that you know is gonna ruin their life.

132
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,440
Just me and a whole lot of sunshine.

133
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,440
So what's stopping you?

134
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,020
Two hours on the beach, and I lose my mind.

135
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,300
That, and I could never take Taylor out of school.

136
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,800
He's doing good, you know?

137
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,390
He's making decent grades, decent friends,

138
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,730
and Taylor is very proud of his mom.

139
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,930
I'll bet he is.

140
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,030
Hey, partner, what you working on?

141
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,490
It's just a cold case. Nothing urgent.

142
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,550
Glasses and Cocoa Puffs are gonna pay a visit

143
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,460
to Elias' guy Carlo.

144
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,630
Maybe I should stay here and help with this case.

145
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,110
You're not exactly employee of the month.

146
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,350
You saying I'm a bad cop?

147
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,270
I'm saying you're a terrible cop.

148
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,310
Everything okay with you?

149
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,890
Go help Finch. I got things covered.

150
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,840
Caught a big one.

151
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,420
Home invasion, Park Avenue.

152
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,360
Quadruple homicide.

153
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,740
I'll show you how it's done.

154
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,510
You're the rook. You keep the file.

155
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,280
Pattersons got a lot of dough,

156
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,820
which means they got a lot of lawyers too.

157
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,650
You get what I'm saying?

158
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,780
Yeah, we do this by the book.

159
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,700
Exactly, and I'll do all the talking.

160
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,670
I'm sorry, sir, but Mr. Patterson

161
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,400
requested not to be disturbed.

162
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,000
It's Detective.

163
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,060
Need to take a quick look around this place.

164
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,790
Chase--Mr. Patterson's been staying in a different apartment

165
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,430
in the building since he got back,

166
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,550
just until he sells the penthouse where it happened.

167
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,900
Tell you what, I'll call the building manager,

168
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,380
see if he can show you around.

169
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,890
All right, so we have four victims.

170
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,640
Mom, dad, two of their grown kids.

171
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,240
I found them here this morning tied up,

172
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,450
throats slit.

173
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,000
Do we buy this home invasion

174
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,480
in a doorman building on Park Avenue?

175
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,060
Could be an inside job.

176
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,410
You said two of their grown kids.

177
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,690
Is there another?

178
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,910
Chase Patterson, 18, only son.

179
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,510
Got kicked out of bordering school last year

180
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,440
because they found drug paraphernalia in his dorm.

181
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,300
He's the one who found them.

182
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,620
You looking for something specific, Detective?

183
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,960
It's just a busy day.

184
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,430
And you were all present last night.

185
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,140
We left after dinner was served.

186
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,090
And the youngest kid, Chase, never showed.

187
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,220
That's right.

188
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,360
Did he get along with his parents?

189
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,640
There was friction there.

190
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,500
So Chase and his parents fought.

191
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,260
Constantly.

192
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,430
But you didn't hear anything

193
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,710
the night of the murders?

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,190
Nothing.

195
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,670
You know what this is?

196
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,420
You got me.

197
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,730
Pure jade.

198
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,880
Easy to carry, easy to pawn

199
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,000
for a good 20 grand.

200
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,090
So if Chase killed his family

201
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,020
and stole their things for drug money,

202
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,250
why leave this behind?

203
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,370
Why don't you ask him?

204
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,460
What happened, Chase?

205
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,390
I went out for the night.

206
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,710
I didn't want to wake anyone when I came home.

207
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,690
What did you see?

208
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,690
Tessa, then my other sister,

209
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,140
and my parents all tied up in a row.

210
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,030
Someone had cut their throats.

211
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,510
So why was your whole family home that night?

212
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,880
We had dinner there every Sunday.

213
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,590
Then where were you?

214
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,100
Come on, Chase, what aren't you telling me?

215
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,460
Nothing.

216
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,220
I've already told my side.

217
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,620
So why are you hiding it now?

218
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,840
I'm not hiding it.

219
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,060
I told her.

220
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,890
- Her? - The detective.

221
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,010
Carter, that was her name, right?

222
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,260
I gave her my alibi.

223
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,820
Now, tell me, Chase, where were you last night?

224
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,510
At our cabin in the Catskills.

225
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,110
Doing what?

226
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,670
Relapsing.

227
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,080
Before last night, I had been clean for six months.

228
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,910
Your parents believe that?

229
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,350
After my last relapse,

230
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,740
my mom found me unresponsive

231
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,330
in my bedroom.

232
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,110
She told me she held my hand

233
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,410
all the way from home to the hospital.

234
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,830
Didn't let it go until I woke up.

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,130
That sounds about right for a mom.

236
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,160
I had to go to rehab.

237
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,670
Every day,

238
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,980
my mom would walk me to meetings.

239
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,130
I told her, "You're treating me like a child."

240
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,790
And what did she have to say about that?

241
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,270
That I was a child,

242
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,430
her child.

243
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,580
When I went home this morning,

244
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,240
I was going to ask her to forgive me,

245
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,890
and then

246
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,760
she was gone.

247
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,830
They were all gone.

248
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,750
Okay, Chase, you didn't do it.

249
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,730
Who did?

250
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,240
Tell me.

251
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,730
Either charge me or release me.

252
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,550
Some junkie kid kills his entire family for drug money.

253
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,750
Then he sneaks off to a cabin

254
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,720
so no one can corroborate his alibi.

255
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,770
Come on, you said it yourself.

256
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,360
When was the last time you heard of a home invasion

257
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,570
in a doorman building on Park Avenue?

258
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,880
Why don't you want to arrest him?

259
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,250
I looked into his eyes.

260
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,850
He's damaged,

261
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,970
but there is no way in hell

262
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,830
he slit his mother's throat.

263
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,040
Terney.

264
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,390
Thank you.

265
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,100
The murderer's DNA came back a familial match.

266
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,970
I'm going to the cabin,

267
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,000
see if I can corroborate his story.

268
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,820
- Thank you, Carlo. - Keep that psycho away from me.

269
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,530
Hey, Harold, did you talk with Elias' guy, Carlo?

270
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,910
Ms. Groves just finished questioning him.

271
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,760
It appears that Carlo went to the deli

272
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,250
to cash in a free sandwich coupon.

273
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,770
While he was waiting for it,

274
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,890
Dominic's men entered

275
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,850
and headed for the chips and dip.

276
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,420
Should've had a picnic.

277
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,060
It does appear that this was a crime of opportunity,

278
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,300
which means that the Machine

279
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,660
is indeed functioning as intended.

280
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,080
Have you determined whether Mr. Patterson

281
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,890
is a victim or a perpetrator?

282
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,040
Not yet, but I'm following him.

283
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,200
I'll meet you.

284
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,440
You're trying to stop a gang war, remember?

285
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,110
So now that you know all of my retirement plans,

286
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,070
what has the man in the suit

287
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,280
got planned after he hangs up the suit?

288
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,870
I haven't given it much thought.

289
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,960
Don't play with me, John.

290
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,040
I just cleaned my service weapon.

291
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,740
Now, spill.

292
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,610
There is no after for people like us.

293
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,530
No beach for you

294
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,180
and no retirement for me.

295
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,470
We don't do fairy tales.

296
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,450
That's how we're built.

297
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,350
You don't really believe that.

298
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,970
Tell me something.

299
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,480
How'd you wind up here in the first place?

300
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,570
I'm pretty sure you drove us here.

301
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,020
No, here, in this car, drinking cold coffee,

302
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,840
stalking a bar owner in the middle of the night.

303
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,080
Well, where else should I be?

304
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,090
You went to law school.

305
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,170
How about a corner office downtown?

306
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,540
Thank you for proving my point.

307
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,410
I started off on one path,

308
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,930
but I changed,

309
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,320
because that wasn't the end game for me, John.

310
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,140
You can change too.

311
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,050
No one changes, Carter.

312
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,170
You're here because this is where you were always headed.

313
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,660
"No one changes," says the man

314
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,310
who was a hobo the first night I met him.

315
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,050
You might not have changed,

316
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,910
but your wardrobe has.

317
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,470
So whatever path you were on,

318
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,580
you took a detour.

319
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,450
Yeah, but I'll get where I'm going soon enough.

320
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,100
And what does that mean?

321
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,140
Hey, good news.

322
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,280
Glasses told me to bring you dinner.

323
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,460
Am I interrupting something?

324
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,920
No, but hot dogs aren't dinner, Fusco,

325
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,370
not for normal people.

326
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,760
Guess it's the thought that counts.

327
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,010
You don't want my help? No problem.

328
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,520
I got better places to be.

329
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,930
Good luck with this one.

330
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,610
What did you mean, John?

331
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,300
I just meant things tend to work out

332
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,960
the way they're supposed to.

333
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,920
All right. Whatever you like.

334
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,700
And what does that mean?

335
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,540
It means there are two kinds of friends,

336
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,280
ones you talk about the game with

337
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,180
and ones you share your life with--

338
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,580
the real stories.

339
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,380
Up to you which one you want me to be.

340
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,100
But you need to decide,

341
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,670
because, for a spy, lying isn't your strong suit.

342
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,140
Someone here?

343
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,590
Chase.

344
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,480
I just came here to talk.

345
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,650
Why don't you come out where I can see you?

346
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,710
- Carter. - Better get back here.

347
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,430
I can't. I think Chase was here.

348
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,910
Not unless you're at JFK.

349
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,960
The kid took off on a flight to Paris

350
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,360
an hour ago.

351
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,600
And we caught a new one.

352
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,080
Domestic gone wrong, Lower East Side.

353
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,470
No, what about the Pattersons?

354
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,300
I'm sorry, Carter. You're breaking up.

355
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,160
Detective.

356
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,280
It isn't wise to sneak up on people.

357
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,630
I wasn't sneaking. This is my place.

358
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,460
But those drugs aren't mine.

359
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,020
What do you mean?

360
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,140
I mean someone must've put them there.

361
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,070
Someone? Who?

362
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,870
Phil, what's going on?

363
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,750
It's Gil, not Phil,

364
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,760
and that's the last time you're gonna make that mistake,

365
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,800
brother.

366
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,280
Brother?

367
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,450
Not that I'm proud to call a drug addict loser

368
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,780
my brother.

369
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,790
Probably got that from your mother's side.

370
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,070
You're saying my father--

371
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,430
Our father!

372
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,370
He knew my mom in high school.

373
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,840
He was real nice to her till he knocked her up.

374
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,770
That's who our father was.

375
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,800
And because of that, you killed him

376
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,440
and my entire family.

377
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,920
What about my family?

378
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,760
When my mom died, I had nobody,

379
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,410
so I tracked my father down,

380
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,930
but he had a new family,

381
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,240
and he tried paying me to go away.

382
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,020
Any father who would give up his son twice

383
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,670
doesn't deserve to have a family.

384
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,160
Why not kill me too?

385
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,260
Oh, I planned to,

386
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,540
but you went away.

387
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,650
And I had to bide my time for seven years,

388
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,230
and now I get to watch you kill yourself.

389
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,260
Sit.

390
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,960
Pick up the pills.

391
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,490
Swallow them.

392
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,430
I give you about eight hours to live.

393
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,490
There's no need to be scared.

394
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,230
I'll be sitting right here with you.

395
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,030
I'll be watching every minute of your death.

396
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,820
Detective.

397
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,060
You cops sure have a knack

398
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,450
for showing up at the wrong time.

399
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,680
Your colleague, that lady detective,

400
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,530
she interrupted me too.

401
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,570
Back then, I was too scared to kill a cop.

402
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,660
You know, she got shot last year anyway?

403
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:14,950
Goes to show, I should've killed her

404
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,420
when I had the chance.

405
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:21,010
When your number's up-- well, you know the saying.

406
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,780
Can't dig a hole without a shovel.

407
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,610
Don't you go anywhere.

408
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,640
You're not cold? I'm freezing here.

409
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,690
So we're talking about the weather now?

410
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,560
Fine, what do you want to talk about, Carter?

411
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,830
It's not what I want to talk about.

412
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,430
It's what I'm willing to talk about if you want to.

413
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,860
The night we met,

414
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,910
transit picked you up on the J train at Canal.

415
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,240
So maybe you were going

416
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,910
to pay a traffic ticket at 3:00 AM,

417
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,000
or maybe you were going to take a walk

418
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,740
on the Brooklyn Bridge.

419
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,920
Is that the path you were talking about?

420
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,590
Her name was Jessica,

421
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,380
although I think you already know that.

422
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,890
She liked the rain,

423
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,890
sleeping in.

424
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,120
She told really bad jokes

425
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,350
and called me out when I pretended to enjoy them.

426
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,050
And her laugh--

427
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,940
God, I loved her laugh.

428
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,070
You can't blame yourself for what happened to her, John.

429
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,000
It's not a question of blame. It's a fact.

430
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,300
She needed me, and I left her behind.

431
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,150
Can I ask why?

432
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,570
I thought I wasn't gonna make it back alive.

433
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,000
She deserved a better life

434
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,700
than waiting to become a widow.

435
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,830
She deserved happiness.

436
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,580
Not quite how it worked out, though.

437
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,980
Sorry, John.

438
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,740
But I'm not buying it.

439
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,900
You may be able to fool your police shrink

440
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,070
with that version, maybe even yourself.

441
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,800
But not you, huh?

442
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,970
No, you're forgetting, I was over there too.

443
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,980
You'd already been deployed once

444
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,370
when you broke things off.

445
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,670
Hell, you were already active military when you met,

446
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:06,240
so you want to tell me what really happened?

447
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,270
What does it matter now?

448
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,030
It matters because I'm afraid you're gonna use

449
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,120
this poor woman to shut everybody out

450
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,710
right until the bitter end,

451
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,830
because whatever it is you're not telling me,

452
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,350
that's the real reason why you're alone, John.

453
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,450
And because time is running out.

454
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,650
Time?

455
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,410
Hell, we got all the time in the world.

456
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,110
Benny's asleep.

457
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,210
Be hours before Finch brings us breakfast.

458
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,750
No, listen to me, John.

459
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,450
Your time is running out.

460
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,300
You're dying, John.

461
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,080
What?

462
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,840
I don't understand.

463
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,740
You got him, John,

464
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,690
the monster that killed Chase's family,

465
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,900
and he got you pretty good too.

466
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,140
You managed to get to Chase's car.

467
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,160
You need to get help, and if you don't,

468
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,280
you're going to die, and so is Chase.

469
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,130
I lost some blood, but I don't think

470
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,280
I'll bleed out before they get here.

471
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,280
Before who gets here?

472
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,750
Fusco, Finch, maybe Root.

473
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,520
You forgetting?

474
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,870
You didn't tell anybody you were coming up here.

475
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,890
True to form,

476
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,470
you didn't reach out,

477
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,200
so I'm afraid, John, it's just me and you.

478
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,020
But you're right.

479
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,770
You probably won't bleed to death.

480
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,250
It's the cold that'll kill you first,

481
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,430
unless you do something about it.

482
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,030
You need to get those keys, John.

483
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,300
Hey, Glasses.

484
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,500
That info from Carlo lead to anything?

485
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,150
Sadly, no, and I've been trying unsuccessfully

486
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,920
to reach Mr. Reese.

487
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,240
Yeah, well, good luck.

488
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,950
I haven't seen or heard from the coiffed Columbo

489
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,050
since this morning.

490
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,960
Really?

491
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,500
Why, something got you worried?

492
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,310
Nothing in particular.

493
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,230
Where was he last time you guys talked?

494
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Following Chase Patterson.

495
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,780
Patterson--that's the case Wonder Boy pulled?

496
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,290
I'm afraid so.

497
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,890
Well, if you do hear from him,

498
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,400
will you let me know?

499
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,220
Yeah, sure thing.

500
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,450
You worry too much, Harry.

501
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,680
I'm sure wherever he is,

502
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,020
the big lug can take care of himself.

503
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,260
All right, keep it moving.

504
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,610
You know how this works: you stop, you die.

505
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,330
Come on, you've seen worse than this.

506
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,460
You didn't really survive all of that

507
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,110
to just wind up dying now,

508
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:43,640
out here, alone, at the hands of a psycho

509
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,700
who got off one lucky shot.

510
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,940
I didn't think so.

511
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,560
Attaboy, John.

512
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,140
I knew you could do it.

513
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,010
You sure you were an interrogator,

514
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,820
not a drill sergeant?

515
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,990
I thought you liked following orders.

516
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,850
Now, you think you can make it back?

517
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,670
Gonna bleed to death.

518
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,570
Least I'm gonna listen to some good music.

519
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,740
At least we can agree on this one.

520
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,880
I missed you.

521
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,940
That's good.

522
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,770
Being missed means you meant something to people

523
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,350
while you were here.

524
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,610
So...

525
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,180
You're a cop now?

526
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,000
- Not a real one. - No?

527
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,240
Well, that shield looks pretty real.

528
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,820
And so does the dead bad guy in the snow.

529
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,030
Even got you a partner. Poor Fusco.

530
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:24,860
{\an9}*At midnight they will all be singing Auld Lang Syne*

531
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,920
Wait.

532
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,100
What are we still doing here?

533
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,140
I can drive us back.

534
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,990
John, listen to me.

535
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,360
There's something wrong with this heater.

536
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,560
- No, there's not. - I'm burning up in here.

537
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,420
Why can I see your breath?

538
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,540
It's not too hot. It's too cold.

539
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,800
Engine won't start.

540
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,370
Cars don't like the cold.

541
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,780
Come on, John.

542
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,220
You know this.

543
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,410
The heat you're feeling is a hallucination,

544
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,360
the last symptom of hypothermia.

545
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,060
You're freezing to death, John.

546
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,090
John. John!

547
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,870
You got to stay awake. Concentrate.

548
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,320
Where are you going?

549
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,930
The highway. I can flag down a car.

550
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,320
That's the hypothermia talking. You're confused.

551
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,230
I'm not. Look, here comes one.

552
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,380
Step out of this car, and you die.

553
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,390
But the light.

554
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,740
That's not headlights. That's the moon.

555
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,900
The moon?

556
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,130
The storm passed.

557
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,920
No one's coming.

558
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,340
He's really got you worried, doesn't he, Harry?

559
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,670
John has always maintained a certain distance,

560
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,350
but this is not like him.

561
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,080
So have you found anything?

562
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,280
I managed to isolate the location

563
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,210
of his phone's last connection to our mesh network.

564
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,110
Unfortunately the signal was lost soon after,

565
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,570
and I have no other means of determining his location.

566
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,280
I'm sorry, Harry.

567
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,200
Beautiful, isn't it?

568
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:09,220
No noise, no people.

569
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,840
Nothing.

570
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,230
May as well tell me

571
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,660
why you really left her behind.

572
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,340
No point taking secrets where you're going.

573
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,570
Trust me.

574
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,160
First tour--

575
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,160
we were outside of Herat,

576
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,730
making our way through the mountains at night.

577
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,110
We heard shooting.

578
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,110
Group of Rangers

579
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,760
stumbled into the Taliban in the dark.

580
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,100
And by the time we got there, they were all dead.

581
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,320
Both sides.

582
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,380
Just one of those things.

583
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,750
We had to be over the mountains by sunrise,

584
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,740
so we searched them, took their tags,

585
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,830
their water, their ammunition,

586
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,400
and we just kept moving.

587
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,720
And I noticed something.

588
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,210
They all had a picture:

589
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,730
girlfriend, wife, kid.

590
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,520
After a while, I realized

591
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,280
everybody I found, on either side, had a picture.

592
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,930
They were fighting for something.

593
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,760
They were dying for something.

594
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,570
I figured maybe if I didn't have a picture

595
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,220
to carry around with me

596
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,850
I'd be better at my job,

597
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,850
so when I got back,

598
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,420
I broke things off with Jessica.

599
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,890
Maybe you're right, then.

600
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,020
Maybe this is the path you've been on all along,

601
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,020
path that led you right here.

602
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,630
Don't reach out to anyone, shut everybody out.

603
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,530
- Not everyone. - What?

604
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,480
I didn't shut you out.

605
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,880
We had a connection.

606
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,690
I could talk with you about important things,

607
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,910
the things that really mattered.

608
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,950
But, John,

609
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,190
you never did.

610
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:03,300
What? Of course I did.

611
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,650
That night we were staking out the bar.

612
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,890
- We talked. - Yes, we talked about music.

613
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,060
- Our jobs. - And Jessica.

614
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,260
No, John.

615
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,130
Yes, I told you about her,

616
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,530
how she liked the rain and sleeping in.

617
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,270
I wish we'd had that conversation,

618
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,060
but we never did.

619
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,380
Here, this picture.

620
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,230
Remember?

621
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,920
You kept this, and you gave it to me

622
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,990
when we talked about her that night.

623
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,990
I kept the photo, but I never gave it to you.

624
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:43,940
You were talking about a path you were on.

625
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,110
I asked if you wanted to talk about it,

626
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,430
and you didn't.

627
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,720
- I did. - No.

628
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,370
You cracked a couple jokes.

629
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,540
Then you turned the radio up,

630
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,480
and that was it.

631
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,410
We never got to Jessica.

632
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,370
I kept that photo

633
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,620
to give to you at the right moment,

634
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,280
when you were willing to share that part of yourself with me,

635
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,850
but you never were, John.

636
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,640
It's like you said.

637
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:23,840
You're here because you were always headed here.

638
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:30,520
I wanted to talk to you about her.

639
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,050
I just wish we had more time.

640
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,430
Yeah, well, that's something we never get enough of.

641
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,440
You're right.

642
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,530
I don't let people in.

643
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,790
That's not why I didn't tell anyone about the case.

644
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,080
I wanted to close this one myself.

645
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,360
- Just me. - Why?

646
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,850
It was a chance to be close to you again.

647
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,750
And I didn't want to share that with anyone else.

648
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,800
There's another reason why I kept that photo.

649
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,360
It was a side of you I hadn't seen.

650
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,690
Happy, hopeful.

651
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,670
In love.

652
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,370
You can feel that way again, John.

653
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,040
You just got to hold on.

654
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,980
There are people who care about you,

655
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,020
who can love you.

656
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,560
Just got to let them in.

657
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,800
It's like what you told me before:

658
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,340
whether I liked it or not,

659
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,160
I wasn't alone.

660
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,320
Neither are you.

661
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,310
Will you stay with me just for a little bit?

662
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,250
Yes, of course.

663
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:28,890
Just hold on, John.

664
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,050
I love the days we spent

665
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,990
Together

666
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,940
Before the old year lost

667
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:57,340
Its shine

668
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,940
I'll keep that memory locked

669
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:06,160
Within my heart

670
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,580
Hey, Joss.

671
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,760
We made it.

672
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,460
That happy new year

673
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,320
You

674
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:20,240
Were mine
